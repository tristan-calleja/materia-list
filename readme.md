## SEI-23 Project 4 – Materia-List

https://materia-list.herokuapp.com/

### Pitch
We live in a consumerist society. Most of us consume way more than we should and that's especially true when it comes to things like clothing, electronics, etc.
We get targeted by ads all the time and it’s hard to resist temptation often. in the bus, on instagram, on the side of your browser, in your mailbox, etc.
Here comes the <strong>Materia-List</strong>.

Our goal is to help you keep track of the things you really want.
A new envy? List it in <strong>Materia-List</strong>! 
Once you have a budget, look through your list and see what you could do with your money.

Buy Less, Buy Better.

- Give the user a budget that he can adjust and link to other models.
- Random suggestions through databases.
- Alerts for price drops.

### Approach & Process
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for database relationships
- Wireframes for draft user interface and experience
- Trello for project management 
- One route, one model, basic front-end, repeat
- Deploy and populate database on Heroku

### Technologies used

- MongoDB
- React
- HTML, CSS
