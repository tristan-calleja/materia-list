## Materia-List

We all know that we live in a consumerist society. We get targeted by ads all the time and it’s hard to resist temptation often.

Materialist is a List App that helps you to keep track of the things you want to buy: clothes, shoes, watches, wines, etc.
The idea is that people can’t lose focus of what they really want and people start buying goods that last as opposed to the last thing they’ve seen on an Instagram sponsored post or on ASOS.
